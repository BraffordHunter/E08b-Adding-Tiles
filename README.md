This is a continuation on creating a paddle ball game. There is a paddle, a ball and walls on three corners. The way you lose is from the ball falling off the map. The way you win, is by lasting longer keeping ball in play than you did before. Unless you are competing with someone else, than you try to keeping it going longer than they can. That is how you could possibly win. Athough I made a bit more of a challenging version than the original assignment. Where keeping the ball from falling is a bit more difficult. The blocks can also be more challenging to knock out.
